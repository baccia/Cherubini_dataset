# Uncertainties

* Solfèges No. 5, 26, 33, 40 m. 1: No way to express the repetition symbol in the middle of the bar has been found yet.
* Solfège No. 6 m. 3: The slur has been prolonged to cover all notes of the bar. Compare m. 11.
* Solfège No. 6 m. 4: In the manuscript the slur seems to be rather short. It has been prolonged to cover the whole phrase.
* Solfège No. 11 m. 2: The position of the beam of the 8th notes has been changed to appear above the notes. In the manuscript it is positioned between f' and b'.
* Solfège No. 28 m. 2: The exact position of the slur is not clearly written in the manuscript. Maybe the D5 should be included in the slur. It has been omitted in the incipit.
* Solfège No. 33 m. 6: The position of the beam of the 16th notes has been changed to appear underneath the notes. In the manuscript it is positioned between a' and d'.
* Solfèges No. 42 m. 4, No. 51 m. 5+7: In the handwriting the acciaccatura is crossed out with to lines instead of the common one line. This symbol cannot be expressed in MEI.
* Solfège 53 mm. 1–2: If placed above the staff the bass figures are rendered above the tempo indication. To avoid this the figures have been placed below the staff as an exception. For better readability the "simili" in the handwriting in m. 2 has been omitted and the first cue note has been written out instead.
