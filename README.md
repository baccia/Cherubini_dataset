# Cherubini_dataset
Dataset for a catalogue of Luigi Cherubini's pedagogical works

## Description
The dataset "Cherubini" contains the MEI files with the music incipits for a planned online catalogue of Luigi Cherubini's pedagogical works.
This is an output of the project [Luigi Cherubini und die Kompositionslehre am Pariser Conservatoire als umfassende Ausbildungspraxis (ca. 1810-1840)](https://www.hkb-interpretation.ch/projekte/luigicherubini) and will eventually be published on a [dedicated website](https://luigicherubini.hkb.bfh.ch/).

## Documentation
* Incipits are written in MuseScore 4 first, then exported into mei and completed with mei-friend. mscz files are kept only for documentation, they are not equivalent to mei files.
* Title and composer information is contained in fileDesc. It is not visible because the pgHead element is empty.
