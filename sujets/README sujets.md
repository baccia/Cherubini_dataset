# Documentation Sujets de Fugue

## Unsolved issues

* Up to now there has not been found a way to depict a dotted note that lasts into the next measure without a tied note. This applies to sujets 5 and 10.
* The stretto and réponse ideas that exist for some sujets are not contained in the incipits.

## Errata

* In Curtice's edition the title of sujet 8.2 is ›Sujet de Fugue 8 Version 2: F-Pn Ms. 1691 (1)‹. The source mentioned contains 74 solfèges. This is a mistake. The source containing sujets de fugue is F-Pn Ms. 1693 (1). The title of the incipit of sujet 8.2 has been corrected.
* Sujet 20 m. 7: The flat may be an error in the edition  since it is already contained in the key signature. This will be checked.
