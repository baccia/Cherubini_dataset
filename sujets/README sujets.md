# Documentation Sujets de Fugue

## Unsolved issues

* Up to now there has not been found a way to depict a dotted note that lasts into the next measure without a tied note. This applies to sujets 5 and 10.
* The stretto and réponse ideas that exist for some sujets are not contained in the incipits.

## Errata

* In the edition the title of sujet 8.2 is ›Sujet de Fugue 8 Version 2: F-Pn Ms. 1691 (1)‹. The source mentioned contains 74 solfèges. A source containing sujets de fugue is F-Pn Ms. 1693 (1). This may be an error in the edition and has been corrected in the title of incipit 8.2.
* Sujet 20 m. 7: The flat may be an error in the edition  since it is already contained in the key signature. This will be checked.
